    Modelling the Limit Order Book as a continuous time Markov
Process
   </h1>

    <em>Learning about market microstructure</em>

   <p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_order_book">Limit
Order Book</a> is an order matching method that’s used by most financial
exchanges. On an exchange with an order book participants submit buy
orders called “bids” and sell orders called “asks” alongside the
quantity of the asset that they would like to buy or sell.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a diagram it looks a bit like this
   </p>
   <p>
    <img src="/blog/images/limit-order-book.png">
   </p>
   <p>
    These buy orders and sell orders are kept either somebody submits
what’s called a “market order” or the trader that placed the order
cancels it. A market order is an order that effectively asks to buy or
sell at the best price available no matter what it is. For example, if
the order book for a stock has two ask orders both with quantity 1 at
$194 and $195 for one stock then if I submit a market order to buy this
stock then the exchange would match me with the $194 ask order from the
order book and we would trade at this price: I get the stock from the
seller and the seller gets $194 from me. After this we’ve traded the ask
order is removed from the order book since it only had quantity 1.
   </p>
   <p>
    We call the difference between the most aggressive (highest) bid
price and the most aggressive (lowest) ask price the bid-ask spread.
Zero-intelligence models model the dynamics of the orderbook as a random
process and even though they don’t model the individual behaviour of
traders in the market according to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0409157102">Farmer et al.
(2005)</a> they are able to predict up to 95% of the variance in the
bid-ask spread.
   </p>
   <p>
    Typically we model the arrival of bid and ask orders as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson
process</a> which looks like this as an SDE
   </p>
   <p>
    \[dN_t = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;\text{with probability } \lambda dt \\
0 &amp;\text{with probability } 1 - \lambda dt \end{cases} \]
   </p>
   <p>
    In a basic model we can have independent poisson processes describing
the arrival of bids ands asks for every possible price or “tick” so we’d
have a poisson process describing the dynamics of $1 bids, $2 bids and
so on. In this model we also use a poisson process to describe how bids
and asks exit the order book. This is a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory">queueing model</a>
called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth%E2%80%93death_process">birth-death
process</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    If we use \(\mu\) to refer to the rate at which orders leave our
order book queues then we have the neat result that if \(\lambda &lt;
\mu\) then our queueing system has a time-invariant steady state
distribution. This means that in the long run our queue doesn’t grow
indefinitely and we has a statistical distribution that doesn’t change
throughout time, namely a geometric distribution with parameter \(1 -
\frac{\lambda}{\mu}\). Furthermore, we can actually characterise the
behaviour of this queue with a parameter \(\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}\)
and our queue is stable if \(\lambda &lt; \mu\) or \(\rho &lt; 1\).
   </p>
   <p>
    In a simple system we have a perfect market maker who maintains a
spread of exactly one tick. In this system we have a flat order book
with unit bids and asks at every tick above the midprice and after a
market order comes in and clears a limit order the dealer will place a
bid to maintain the spread of 1 tick. However there are two ways of
doing this: the the dealer can either submit a limit order on the same
side as the incoming market order or on the opposite side. If we call
the probability that the dealer places a limit orde on the same side as
the market order \(u\) then we can model the midprice directly with an
SDE.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using \(P\) to denote the midprice, \( N_t^{\text{buy}} \sim
\operatorname{Poisson}(\gamma^{\text{buy}})\) and \(N_t^{\text{sell}}
\sim \operatorname{Poisson}(\gamma^\text{sell})\) to denote the poisson
processes describing the incoming market buy orders and the market sell
orders respectively, \(\Delta P\) to denote the smallest increment in
price and \(Z \sim \operatorname{Bernoulli}(u)\) to represent the
Bernoulli distributed random variable denoting which side the market
maker places their limit order then we get the following SDE describing
the dynamics of the mid price.
   </p>
   <p>
    \[ dP = \Delta P (dN^{\text{buy}}_t - dN^{\text{sell}}_t) Z \]
   </p>
   <p>
    Now, using a little bit of functional analysis we can work out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal_generator_%28stochastic_processes%29">infinitesimal
generator</a> for our system. The infinitesimal generator describes the
evolution of our system over a small time frame. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUYQL_R7Sg0">this lecture
video</a> helpful for getting a better idea of what the infinitesimal
generator is and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tcGxfkgkg8">this lecture</a> that
walks through the derivation of the infinitesimal generator for a
Poisson process. By definition, our infinitesimal generator looks like
this
   </p>
   <p>
    \[ \begin{align*} \mathcal{L}_f(p) &amp;= \lim_{t \to 0^+}
\frac{\mathbb E \left[ \left. f(P_t) \right| P_0 = p \right] - f(p)}{t}
\\ &amp;= \lim_{t \to 0^+} \frac{\mathbb E \left[ \left. f(P_t) - f(p)
\right| P_0 = p \right]}{t} \\ &amp;= u \left( \gamma^{\text{buy}}
\left(f(p + \Delta P) - f \right) + \gamma^{\text{sell}} \left( f(p -
\Delta P) - f\right) \right) \\ &amp;= \frac{1}{2}u\left(
\gamma^{\text{buy}} + \gamma^{\text{sell}} \right)(\Delta p)^2 \frac{f(p
+ \Delta P) - 2f + f(p - \Delta P)}{\Delta P^2} \\ &amp;+ u \left(
\gamma^{\text{buy}} - \gamma^{\text{sell}} \right) \Delta P \frac{f(p +
\Delta P) - f(p - \Delta P)}{2\Delta P} \end{align*} \]
   </p>
   <p>
    The final equality is a trick from <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/limit-order-books/BF42FB9D69B6D4977363AB38995EE6E2">Gould
et al. (2013)</a>, the textbook I’m learning from. Combined with the
assumptions that \( u\left( \gamma^{\text{buy}} + \gamma^{\text{sell}}
\right)\) tends to \(\sigma^2\) and \(u \left( \gamma^{\text{buy}} -
\gamma^{\text{sell}} \right) \Delta P\) tends to \(\mu\) as the smallest
tick price increment becomes arbitrarily small, this allows us to
rewrite our generator as
   </p>
   <p>
    \[ \frac{\sigma^2}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial p^2} + \mu
\frac{\partial f}{\partial p} \]
   </p>
   <p>
    This corresponds to the the generator for brownian motion with drift
proportional to \(u \left( \gamma^{\text{buy}} - \gamma^{\text{sell}}
\right)\). So in this basic model we find that the midprice is
controlled by how the market maker interacts with the order book with
the \(u\) parameter and also the difference in the arrival rates of
market orders to buy and sell.
   </p>
   <p>
    Taking a step back this makes sense: if \( \gamma^{\text{buy}} &gt;
\gamma^{\text{sell}} \) and on average there are more buy orders than
sell orders then in this model then the drift will be positive and the
price will go up when \(u &gt; 0\). But what does \(u\) represent?
   </p>
   <p>
    While I was learning about banking I learned about the Treynor model
of the dealer in asset markets. In Treynor’s model the dealer is a
profit-seeking agent who attempts to control risk by limiting their
exposure to the asset or how long or short they are on the asset in
question. In Treynor’s model, if the dealer is heavily long on a
security then they will quote lower prices to encourage market
participants to buy from the dealer, allowing the dealer sell and
offload some of their holdings of the asset.
   </p>
   <p>
    Using this idea, I think we can interpret \(u\) as representing how
sensitive the dealer is to market pressure. When \(u\) is 1 then the
dealer will place limit bid orders whenever seeing a market buy order
which moves the price upwards in accordance to market demand. In
Treynor’s model this corresponds to the dealer setting prices to help
control their exposure to the asset that they’re trading.
   </p>
   <p>
    There are more sophisticated models of the order book that are really
interesting. I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWjVQ2Iw8HY">a lecture by Frank
Kelly</a> describing a simple Markovian model of the order book that
rendered some problems analytically tractable. In the lecture he shows
how you can use this model to analyse the game-theoretic nash
equilibrium market making strategies and how they change after
introducing new policies or regulation.
   </p>
   <p>
    <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2014.982278?casa_token=B0xwGJBv1z8AAAAA%3AXRhMLiwHIeVHq593CtkH1k2hQyAaBTfvc-6YKBLu0UgtiGvR6l-eiflK1CGrflCKFkttEsHyqg">Huang
et al. (2015)</a> introduce what they call the queue-reactive model
where the rate at which orders arrive depend on the state of the order
book which turns out to model the stationary state of the order book
really well and closely match empirically observed market data from
exchanges.
   </p>
   <p>
    Learning about modelling order books was really interesting and it
was fun seeing all the different approaches and comparing how they
analyse order book dynamics. The appeareance of the infinitesimal
generator was extremely surprising, my textbook assumed knowledge of it
and didn’t spend any time introducing the idea or explaining how it
works but learning about it was really cool and I found it really
interesting how manipulating it revealed insights into the dynamics of
the system that it modelled.
   </p>
   <p>
    All in all, market microstructure models are really interesting.
