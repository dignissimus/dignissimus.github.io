    I found a question on the Mathematics Stack Exchange page [1] with
the following problem statement.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     All edges of a complete graph are colored: each edge with a red or
blue color. Show that there exists a color such that every two vertices
can be connected by a path with edges of this color of length at most
3.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    I attempted the question and my proof was different to the accepted
answer.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Theorem
   </h1>
   <p>
    If the edges of a complete graph are coloured using two colours then
there is a colour such that every two vertices can be connected by a
path with edges of this colour of length at most three.
   </p>
   <h1>
    Proof
   </h1>
   <p>
    Select an arbitrary colour - either this colour connects all vertices
with a path of length at most three or it does not. In the case that it
does, then we are done. If it does not, then we seek to show that the
other colour connects all vertices with a path with a length that is
less than or equal to three.
   </p>
   <p>
    For arbitrary distinct vertices in the graph \(u, v\), if there is no
edge of the selected colour that connects these two vertices then there
is an edge of the other colour connecting these edges which is a path of
length one.
   </p>
   <p>
    If these two vertices are connected by an edge then there is another
vertex that is adjacent to neither of these vertices. If such a vertex
did not exist then every edge is adjacent to at least one of these
vertices and we could construct a path between any two arbitrary
vertices in the graph by passing using the edge that connects them to
either \(u\) or \(v\) which will use at most three edges. However, this
contradicts the fact that this colour doesn’t connect all vertices with
a path of length at most three as we have just constructed such a path
for arbitrary vertices in the graph so there must be a vertex, \(w\)
that is not adjacent to \(u\) and is also not adjacent to \(v\). The
other colour must therefore connect \(u\) and \(v\) via the path \(uwv\)
which is of length two.
   </p>
   <p>
    \(\square\)
   </p>

    Other ideas
   </h1>
   <p>
    I initially did this by cases on whether each subgraph was connected
before realising the final case encompassed all the other cases.
   </p>
   <p>
    I another had a fun idea of working on cases where I consider whether
two vertices exist in some set that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_subgraph">induces</a> a
\(P_4\) subgraph [2] because \(P_4\) and its subgraphs are paths of
length at most three and \(\overline{P_4} = P_4\) so the existence of
some path of length three or less would be preserved after complementing
the graph but I couldn’t get this to work while it was easy to make the
obvious solution work.
