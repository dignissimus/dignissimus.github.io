    Note to self: Don’t use a compiler from the Mesozoic era
   </h1>
   <p>
    <em>updating my compiler is a suprisingly effective debugging
strategy</em> <strong>18 February 2025</strong>

   <hr>
   <p>
    Earlier this year I was writing code to run on one of my university’s
supercomputers and to make things a bit more convenient for myself I was
developing locally on my laptop and zapping my source changes to the
cluster by working in a private git repository hosted on GitHub. Again
for convenience I compiled my code locally on my laptop and did small
test runs so I can analyse performance before putting them on the
supercomputer however I noticed that a specific loop I wrote wasn’t
being vectorised even though I knew the supercomputer used AMD EPYC 7702
CPUs which I triple checked supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions#Advanced_Vector_Extensions_2">AVX2
instructions</a> so I was expecting to see instructions using the 256
bit YMM registers as the compiler emitted on my own computer.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was very lucky I was feeling lazy and decided to try a more recent
compiler version because that <em>just worked</em>. Fast forwarding GCC
3 years from 2018 to 2021 fixed my issue and the compiler vectorised my
code as I expected.
   </p>
   <p>
    A bit more recently I had something very similar: I was having a go
at compiling
[Lean4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(proof_assistant%29) for <a href="WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> and, since I don’t like waiting for
my code to compile, I had the terrific idea of compiling everything
using my university’s supercomputer. I saw a weird error message
complaining about the use of <code>va_arg</code> which I didn’t have the
patience to read. I updated the compiler version and lo-and-behold
things started working again. More precisely I ran into <a href="https://github.com/libuv/help/issues/128">another issue</a> but I
fixed my original issue and I was happy.
   </p>
   <p>
    So yea, update your compiler.
