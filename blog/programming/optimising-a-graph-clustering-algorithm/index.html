   <h1>
    Optimising a Graph Clustering Algorithm
   </h1>
   <summary>

    Recently, I was tasked to get the highest performance possible on the
<a href="https://github.com/ECP-ExaGraph/miniVite">miniVite</a>
microbenchmark. MiniVite is a slimmed-down version of <a href="https://github.com/ECP-ExaGraph/vite">Vite</a> which implements
the Louvain method for community detection and graph clustering.
   </p>
   <p>
    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method">Louvain
method</a> is composed of two phases and miniVite only implements the
first phase of the algorithm. This phase aggregates vertices into
communities by locally optimising the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modularity_%28networks%29">modularity</a>
metric which measures how well a graph is clustered into communities.
The algorithm works by incremental improvement, at each step it moves a
vertex into the community that leads to the largest increase in the
modularity metric.
   </p>
   <p>
    I was working on Arm hardware so the first course of action was to
use the armclang compiler and the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Performance%20Libraries">Arm
Performance Library</a> implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>
which already gave us a speed up.
   </p>
   <p>
    The miniVite code contains some <code>TODO</code> comments so these
were the first targets for tinkering with the code. The first of which
concerned using TBB’s <a href="https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneTBB/main/tbb_userguide/concurrent_vector_ug.html"><code>concurrent_vector</code></a>
and the second of which concerned parallelising a for loop wih <a href="https://www.openmp.org/">OpenMP</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Algorithmically, we found two enhancements on a different branch
which we were able to incorporate into our local build. The first
enhancement involved implementing an on-stack hashmap for small graph
segments: this is in contrast to the dynamically allocated hashmap that
is used by default.
   </p>
   <p>
    The second enhancement involved calculating the increase in
modularity differently. For every vertex, the Louvain method sums values
for each of the vertex’s neighbours and aggregates these values based on
each of the neighbouring vertices’ current community.
   </p>
   <p>
    Naively, we can implement this by summing values in a hashmap where
the key is a hash for the neighbouring vertex’s community. However, for
small graph segments we can sort the adjacency array by community so
that vertices in the same community become adjacent in contiguous
blocks. We can now find the community that maximises the increase in the
modularity metric by performing a linear scan across the array which
eliminates the random access from the previous implementation which is
much better for the pre-fetcher.
   </p>
   <p>
    Putting everything together, I achieved about a 10x performance boost
for the selected problem instances. We had the best results from this
challenge and the entire competition was so much fun.
