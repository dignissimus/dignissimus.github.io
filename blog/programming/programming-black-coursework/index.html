    Let’s do some coursework
   </h1>
   <summary>
    <p>
     <strong>23 January 2023</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I finally stop procrastinating
    </p>
   </summary>
   <h1>
    06:26
   </h1>
   <p>
    So, it’s the 23rd of January the time is 06:26 and I have to do my
programming coursework that I’ve been postponing for months. I’m not
entirely sure when it’s due in but I have until the end of this week to
finish it.
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:01
   </h1>
   <p>
    So I’ve now spent about 35 minutes playing chess
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:30
   </h1>
   <p>
    I have now spent 30 minutes reading and answering computability
theory questions on Stack Exchange. It wasn’t difficult but it was a fun
exercise to show that a Turing machine with access to an oracle that
determines whether another Turing machine accepts a specified string can
decide the halting problem.
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:35
   </h1>
   <p>
    I’m ready to be productive. My first step here is to understand what
is being asked for. Previously, I constructed a a really cool project
idea where I could create an interface that allowed you to enter
statements in Presburger arithmetic and returned a proof or disproof of
its correctness. The interesting parts come with the proof procedure and
creating the interface for writing formal sentences of Presburger
arithmetic. This project idea, while fun, probably did not directly
address the coursework requirements which I can meet by building
something simpler.
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:46
   </h1>
   <p>
    I’ve read through the specification and the requirements are really
basic. I think I’m going to build a TODO app. I’ve been meaning to write
one for a while, the only thing I’m not that happy about is the fact
that I have to write this in Javascript. I wanted to write my TODO app
in Elm. Realistically, I still can, I probably will in the future and
I’m moaning over nothing.
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:50 - The beginning
   </h1>
   <p>
    I’m going to start by setting up eslint as this is a requirement for
the project.
   </p>
   <h1>
    07:53
   </h1>
   <p>
    I’ve now created my project. I’ve selected the Google Javascript
style for my project and I’ve setup a pretest script that runs eslint. I
think I’ll continue by setting up jest.
   </p>
   <h1>
    08:08
   </h1>
   <p>
    Everything works as expected, I took the liberty in exploring eslint.
It’s quite permissive compared to the black formatter.
   </p>
   <h1>
    08:13
   </h1>
   <p>
    I’ve created the git repository and made the first commit. I don’t
think this is required in the project but not using git feels
un-natural. This project will not be on GitHub, at least for a while, as
making the source code accessible via GitHub would violate the
university policy on academic collusion.
   </p>
   <h1>
    08:16
   </h1>
   <p>
    It would be nice to begin with the interface, but I’m going to begin
by constructing the backend. I’m going to make the infrastructure
stateless in a way.
   </p>
   <h1>
    10:07
   </h1>
   <p>
    Today has been productive, I attended my 9:00am lecture and the basic
structure of the project is now complete. I’m also going to use the
prettier formatter because it’s more strict than eslint.
   </p>
   <h1>
    14:34
   </h1>
   <p>
    The backend of the web application works but I’ve now become bored.
The current task is to write the frontend interface. In the next
coursework I will be able to pick an interesting project of my own
choice.
   </p>
   <h1>
    The end
   </h1>
   <p>
    I finished the coursework, it looks like this
